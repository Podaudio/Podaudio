- 👋 Hi, I’m @Podaudio
- 👀 I’m interested in learning and developing my coding ability  \
- 🌱 I’m currently learning visual basic for applcaions, php and sql.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on database front end developemnt but I consider myself a novice.
- 📫 How to reach me, as yet, i will remain unreachable until i have learned more of how the github community works.

- My interest in programming is born of selfish need to make my own life easier and create sofware solutions to the comercial problems I have in my industry.\
- I hate ineficiancy, and thrive on problem solving the stuff others cant be arsed doing.

- Current problem, my office uses a shared exel document to track projects like the 80's. I NEED to create an online database solution that will allow
- client side registration and login, with permissons based acess to data. 
- Each user class needs to have their own dashboard.

I am new to github and hoped id find a ready made solution here.  If you can help direct me to said solution, add a comment
