- 👋 Hi, I’m @Podaudio
- 👀 I’m interested in learning and developing my coding ability  \
- 🌱 I’m currently learning visual basic for applications, php and sql.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on database front end development, but I consider myself a novice.
- 📫 How to reach me, as yet, I will remain unreachable until I have learned more of how the GitHub community works.

- My interest in programming is born of selfish need to make my own life easier and create software solutions to the commercial problems I have in my industry.\
- I hate inefficiency, and thrive on problem-solving the stuff others cant be arsed doing.

- Current problem, my office uses a shared exel document to track projects like the 80's. I NEED to create an online database solution that will allow
- client side registration and login, with permissions based access to data. 
- Each user class needs to have their own dashboard.

I am new to GitHub and hoped id find a ready-made solution here.  If you can help direct me to said solution, add a comment
